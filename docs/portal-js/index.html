        <p>A customer asked for help with a problem--how to compare two strings
            and determine if the first contains every word in the second, in any
            order, when there are an indeterminate number of words in each string.
            This is a fairly straight-forward problem in ECL. Using JOIN and ROLLUP
            would be one approach, or nested child dataset queries (not supported in
            Thor at the time of the request for help, though they may be by the time
            you read this). All the following code is contained in the Soapcall3.ECL
            file.</p>
        <p>The first need was to create a function that would extract all the
            discrete words from a string. This is the kind of job that the PARSE
            function excels at, so that's exactly what this code does:</p>
        <pre class="programlisting">ParseWords(STRING LineIn) := FUNCTION
  PATTERN Ltrs := PATTERN('[A-Za-z]');
  PATTERN Char := Ltrs | '-' | '\'';
  TOKEN   Word := Char+;
          ds   := DATASET([{LineIn}],{STRING line});
  RETURN PARSE(ds,line,Word,{STRING Pword := MATCHTEXT(Word)});
END;</pre>
        <p>This FUNCTION (contained in Soapcall3.ECL) receives an input string
            and produces a record set result of all the words contained in that
            string. It defines a PATTERN attribute (Char) of allowable characters in a
            word as the set of all upper and lower case letters (defined by the Ltrs
            PATTERN), the hyphen, and the apostrophe. Any other character than these
            will be ignored.</p>
        <p>Next, it defines a Word as one or more allowable Char pattern
            characters. This pattern is defined as a TOKEN so that only the full word
            match is returned and not all the possible alternative matches (i.e.
            returning just SOAP, instead of SOAP, SOA, SO, and S--all the possible
            alternative matches that a PATTERN would generate).</p>
        <p>The one record in-line DATASET attribute (ds) creates the input
            "file" for the PARSE function to work on, producing the result record set
            of all the discrete words from the input string.</p>
        <p>Next, we need a Roxie query to compare the two strings (also
            contained in Soapcall3.ECL):</p>
        <pre class="programlisting" role="runnable">EXPORT Soapcall3() := FUNCTION
  STRING UID     := '' : STORED('UIDstr');
  STRING LeftIn  := '' : STORED('LeftInStr');
  STRING RightIn := '' : STORED('RightInStr');
  BOOLEAN TokenMatch := FUNCTION
    P1 := ParseWords(LeftIn);
    P2 := ParseWords(RightIn);
    SetSrch := SET(P1,Pword);
    ProjRes := PROJECT(P2,
                       TRANSFORM({BOOLEAN Fnd},
                                 SELF.Fnd := LEFT.Pword IN SetSrch));
    AllRes  := DEDUP(SORT(ProjRes,Fnd));
    RETURN COUNT(AllRes) = 1 AND AllRes[1].Fnd = TRUE;
  END;
  RETURN OUTPUT(DATASET([{UID,TokenMatch}],{STRING UID,BOOLEAN res}));
END;</pre>
        <p>There are three pieces of data this query expects to receive: a
            string containing an identifier for the comparison (for context purposes
            in the result), and the two strings whose words to compare.</p>
        <p>The FUNCTION passes the input strings to the ParseWords function to
            create two recordsets of words from those strings. The SET function then
            re-defines the first recordset as a SET so the the IN operator may be
            used.</p>
        <p>The PROJECT operation does all the real work. It passes each word in
            turn from the second input string to its inline TRANSFORM function, which
            produces a Boolean result for that word--TRUE or FALSE, is it present in
            the set of words from the first input string or not?</p>
        <p>To determine if all the words in the second string were contained in
            the first, the SORT/DEDUP sorts all the resulting Boolean values then
            removes all the duplicate entries. There will only be one or two records
            left: either a TRUE and a FALSE, or a single TRUE or FALSE record.</p>
        <p>The RETURN expression detects which of the three scenarios has
            occurred. Two records left indicates some, but not all, of the words were
            present. One record indicates either all or none of the words were
            present, and if the value of that record is TRUE, then all words were
            present and the FUNCTION returns TRUE. All other cases return
            FALSE.</p>
        <p>The OUTPUT uses a one-record inline DATASET to format the result.
            The identifier that was passed in is passed back along with the Boolean
            result of the compare. The identifier becomes important when the query is
            called multiple times in Roxie to process through a dataset of strings to
            compare in a batch mode because the results may not be returned in the
            same order as the input records. If it were only ever used interactively,
            this identifier would not be necessary.</p>
        <p>Once you've saved the query to the Repository, you can test it with
            hThor and/or deploy it to Roxie (hThor will work for testing, but Roxie is
            much faster for production). Either way, you can use SOAPCALL to access it
            like this (the only difference would be the IP and port you target for the
            query (contained in Soapcall4.ECL)):</p>
        <pre class="programlisting">RoxieIP := 'http://127.0.0.1:8002/WsEcl/soap/query/roxie/soapcall3.1'; //Roxie
svc     := 'soapcall3.1';

InRec := RECORD
  STRING UIDstr{XPATH('UIDstr')}; 
  STRING LeftInStr{XPATH('LeftInStr')};
  STRING RightInStr{XPATH('RightInStr')};
END;
InDS := DATASET([
   {'1','the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy red dog','quick fox red dog'},
   {'2','the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy red dog','quick fox black dog'},
   {'3','george of the jungle lives here','fox black dog'},
   {'4','fred and wilma flintstone','fred flintstone'},
   {'5','yomama comeonah','brake chill'} ],InRec);

RS := SOAPCALL(InDS,
               RoxieIP,
               svc,
               InRec,
               TRANSFORM(LEFT),
               DATASET({STRING UIDval{XPATH('uid')},BOOLEAN CompareResult{XPATH('res')}}));

OUTPUT(RS);
</pre>
        <p>Of course, <span class="bold"><strong>you must first change the IP and
                    port in this code to the correct values for your environment</strong></span>.
            You can find the proper IP and port to use by looking at the System
            Servers page of your ECL Watch. To target Doxie (aka ECL Agent or hthor),
            use the IP of your Thor's ESP Server and the port for its wsecl service.
            To target Roxie, use the IP of your Roxie's ESP Server and the port for
            its wsecl service. It's possible that both ESP servers could be on the
            same box. If so, then the difference will only be in the port assignment
            for each.</p>
        <p>The key to this SOAPCALL query is the InRec RECORD structure with
            its XPATH definitions. These must exactly match the part names and the
            STORED names of the query's parameter receiving attributes (NB that these
            are case sensitive, since XPATH is XML and XML is always case sensitive).
            This is what maps the input data fields through the SOAP interface to the
            query's attributes.</p>
        <p>This SOAPCALL receives a recordset as input and produces a recordset
            as its result, making it very similar to the second example above. One
            small change from that previous example of this type is the use of the
            shorthand TRANSFORM instead of an inline TRANSFORM function. Also, note
            that the XPATH for the first field in the DATASET parameter's inline
            RECORD structure contains lower case "uid" while it is obviously
            referencing the query's OUTPUT field named "UID"--the XML returned from the
            SOAP service uses lower case tag names for the returned data
            fields.</p>
        <p>When you run this you'll get a TRUE result for records one and four,
            and FALSE for all others.</p>
